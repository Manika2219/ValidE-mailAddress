Valid Email Address:-


An email address must contain the "@" symbol, and all letters should be in lowercase. To verify the correctness of an email address, you can perform a check using regular expressions.

The process involves using regular expressions to match patterns, followed by the utilization of interfaces to interact with the matched results. Engaging in a Python project to validate email addresses will significantly enhance your programming skills. The entire process is implemented using Python string functions.

In the Python language, the input function serves to evaluate user input, treating it like a Python expression. This project will provide you with insights into using Python string functions to efficiently check and validate email addresses.
